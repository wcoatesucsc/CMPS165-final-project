we can use the DAtaWeb source to take each individual commodity that has a proposed tariff on it and look up the percent of the total US market for that commodity that comes from China, relatively easily

want to see "symmetry": he really likes the brookings institute maps, but he wants us to show how industries/regions could benefit from the tariffs


challenge with county-wide: space constraint


USA population density (pre-existing class visualization) shows that it's possible technically

US Geomap by county
	variables on the right to change between: % population/total, and adversely affected by Chinese tariffs/positively impacted by US tariffs

	also show industry by industry (six products)

market share stuff (total dollar amount): maybe an extra visualization (chart alongside? he wants some more ideas) he wants the impact in total dollar amount
	-Chris likes this idea: add a tooltip on that pie chart showing raw amounts(or bar chart? Suresh might not like pie charts)
	-stacked bar chart?

maybe add a multiline chart or something

differentiation between the negative/positive impact buttons and the individual commodity buttons. Make sure the user can't pick the "negative impact" and "aluminum" buttons at the same time simultaneously
	-maybe hide the positive when showing the negative
	-pick view by industry or view by impact

chord diagram might be a good alternative (either way, should have only three segments: China, US, rest of world)

radar chart/spider chart might be another alternative
keep the same green/red color for all industries
	maybe pick diverging scale 


page layout is important: figure out where to place the buttons, map, legend, other visualization

think about annotations showing why the data shows what it does: telling the story
	-library: d3-annotation by Susie Lu (she also has a legend library)
	-highlight something interesting in the data, focus attention
	-ex: steel jobs are concentrated in the Rust Belt, something about that 
	-don't feel like we need to force an annotation, only do one if it's interesting

pick a default display that's the most interesting

He doesn't like it anymore!
---------------------------------------------------------
-He got the wrong impression in our first meeting, he thought we had data/were going to visualize a projection of how the tariffs would impact employment, rather than just showing the current state of employment/geographic distribution of the affected industries is.
-He would rather see us find data for a projection of how the tariff would impact employment in maybe one product rather than just showing the current state of employment/market share from China of commodities/industries
-If we can't find good data for that (we can't) we should move ahead with what we're doing now, although he doesn't like it very much
-Regardless, we need to have very clear titles/labels/legend so that there's no confusion about what we're visualizing. If we can't claim to show a projection of what the impact will be, don't say something like "The Impact of Trade War", say something more like "Where Industries that Will Be Affected by Trade War are Concentrated"
-He thinks the project as he currently sees it is too shallow

Chris -
	add border lines to make viewing easier, or a zoom in feature
	hide radio buttons based on button clicked

Janesh - 
	make pie chart look better
		perhaps dont evne use pie chart, use donut and put % or raw # in middle

Suresh -
	gave us WSJ newspaper, offers good context
	"market share" is confusing, change to "US imports/Exports", something like that
		either remove or put something that makes more sense, like stacked bar chart

Karthik -
	add legend
	make color differences more clear
	increase stroke for state borders, not county borders
	do stacked bar chart from WSJ

	if you put side by side, look out for width of bar, labels, etc
