<h1>Why?</h1>
<h2>Title: Where Industries Vulnerable to the Trade War are Concentrated</h2>
<h2></h2>
<!--p>
As you may know, the US and China have been going back and forth lately on proposing tariffs. The US announced a steep tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum a few months ago, following up with a much wider range of tariffs, and the Chinese government quickly responded with tariffs on many US agricultural goods, which could have a huge impact on American farming. In the last few days there has actually been some talk of lowering or rolling back these tariffs, but many are still in effect and the tensions are far from over. I'd like to visualize which goods/industries are being targeted, how many people they would affect, and how would they be affected.</p-->

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
The purpose of this project is to visually demonstrate how large of an impact a trade war between China and the United States may have on each nation. The visualization is intended for any groups affected by the tariffs and those concerned with global trade relations. The visualization can also aid economists in getting a better graphic representation of a potential trade war.

        <ul><li>This source only analyzes employment, and how that would be affected by the retaliatory Chinese tariffs. It also combines all the data. I think it would also be interesting to look at individual products or categories that are targeted by these tariffs in addition to examining the tariffs as a whole.</li></ul>
